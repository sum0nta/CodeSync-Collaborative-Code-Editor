## 🆘 Need Help?

### Before Deployment
1. Read [QUICK_DEPLOY.md](./QUICK_DEPLOY.md) first
2. Check [deploy-checklist.txt](./deploy-checklist.txt) for step-by-step guide

### During Deployment
1. Follow the checklist exactly
2. Don't skip environment variables
3. Check [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) troubleshooting section

### After Deployment
1. Use [DEPLOYMENT_URLS.md](./DEPLOYMENT_URLS.md) to track your URLs
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. View Render logs for backend issues

### Common Issues
